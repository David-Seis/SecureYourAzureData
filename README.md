Welcome to this workshop on *SQL Server Security Ground to Cloud*. In this workshop, you'll learn <TODO: Describe what the students will learn>

The focus of this workshop is to understand <TODO: Describe the workshop's primay focus in one sentence>

You'll start by <TODO: Describe what the flow of the workshop will be>, with a focus on how to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions for your organization.

This [github README.MD file](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will cover these at an overview level, with references to much deeper training provided.

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You should have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets.

This workshop expects that you understand <TODO: Enter a brief solution for what a student should know before taking the workshop>.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class:

<TODO: Enter some pre-work courses or books or whatever that the student could use to prep>

<a href="url" target="_blank">A full pre-requisites document is located here</a>. These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to turn off any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.
